# Hobby Card

A hobby card component helps describing a hobby with its name, a short description,
and progress.

- A `Red` card indicates that a hobby needs motivations and practice to
  push further.
- A `Yellow` card indicates that a hobby is in progress.
- A `Green` card indicates that a hobby is completed/going really well.

The color cards are determined by a hobby weight that is in the scale from 1 to 10. 

- Any weight less than 3 considered to be in `Red`. 
- A weight between 3 and 6 considered to be in `Yellow`.
- A weight between 7 and 10 considered to be in `Green`.

You need to pass a definition object to the `Hobby` component to create a `Hobby Card`.

Here is an example definition:

```js
{
    id: "001",
    name: "Singing",
    description: "I love it totally",
    weight: "9",
    look: {
    background: "#0eb30e",
    color: "#FFFFFF",
    },
}
```
Then use it with the `Hobby` component as,

```html
<Hobby hobby={hobby} />
```

## üôÑ Hobby Card - Red

A `Red` hobby card means that a hobby needs attention. Let's see an working example,

<Playground>
    <Hobby hobby={{
      id: "004",
      name: "Yoga",
      description: "Oh, I still need to start",
      weight: "1",
      look: {
        background: "#ff6b6b",
        color: "#FFFFFF",
      },
    }} />
</Playground>

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hobby Card - Yellow

A `Yellow` hobby card means that a hobby is in-progress. Let's see an working example,

<Playground>
    <Hobby hobby={{
      id: "003",
      name: "Reading",
      description: "On my way",
      weight: "5",
      look: {
        background: "#efef04",
        color: "#000",
      },
    }} />
</Playground>

## üöÄ Hobby Card - Green

A `Green` hobby card means that a hobby is doing very well. Let's see an working example,

<Playground>
    <Hobby hobby={{
      id: "001",
      name: "Singing",
      description: "I love it totally",
      weight: "9",
      look: {

        color: "#FFFFFF",
      },
    }} />
</Playground>

## ü§ù All Hobby Cards

Here is an example of how we can loop through hobbies and create a list of hobby cards.

<Playground>
    {() => {
        const hobbies = [
            {
                id: "001",
                name: "Singing",
                description: "I love it totally",
                weight: "9",
                look: {
                    background: "#0eb30e",
                    color: "#FFFFFF",
                },
            },
            {
                id: "003",
                name: "Reading",
                description: "On my way",
                weight: "5",
                look: {
                    background: "#efef04",
                    color: "#000",
                },
            },
            {
                id: "004",
                name: "Yoga",
                description: "Oh, I still need to start",
                weight: "1",
                look: {
                    background: "#ff6b6b",
                    color: "#FFFFFF",
                },
            }
        ];
    return (
      <>
        <div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
            {hobbies.map((hobby, index) => (
              <Hobby key={index} hobby={hobby}></Hobby>
            ))}
        </div>
      </>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
